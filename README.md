this is me editing the contents of my file :)
here is my work for chris:
pull- this updates your local repository from the remote. This should be done often.

fetch- this allows you to update all your remote tracking branches if you might lose network connection.

push- thus updates the remote branch with your local commit changes once you finish work with them.

merge- this will update the current branch with new commits on the remote tracking branch.

commit- this is a section of your repository and you can make them often to track and describe progress on your repository's journey.

fork- this is like a bigger version of a branch that allows you to interract with the entire repository and experiment without changing the "upstream" repository. Forks can be merged eventually to become a part of the repository if your work is successful.

clone- this creates a copy of a repository or branch of a repository at one point in your progress.

branches- this lets you to do work on a section of your repository in an isolated way, without changing it, allowing you to experiment or troubleshoot.
